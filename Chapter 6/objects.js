// Objects
/**
 * An object is a container for related data and functions, usually the functions act on the objects data
 *  If an object had a function that didn't affect any of it's data, the function would be a candidate for being a different object altogether, or sometime we call a static context

// Prototype Manipulation
// You can add function type properties in the constructor function
// This is useful if a given function should be a property of all objects of a given type
// This is how JS traditionally creates classes

function Dog(name, breed, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.age = age;
  // This is bad practice but will work
  this.speak = function () {
    alert(`${this.name} says Woof Woof!`);
  };
}

// Instead you would do it like this, adding the function to the prototype property after the constructor, these can be added anywhere in the codebase
Dog.prototype.trick = function () {
  return `${this.name} rolls over`;
};

let rex = new Dog('Rex', 2, 'Lab');
console.log(rex.trick());

// Later ES6 classes were introduced to mimic the same effect as above with classes (greater familiarity between languages)
